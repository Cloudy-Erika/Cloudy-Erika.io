  Welcome!  I must say, you look ravashing!  Anyway, you're here because you want to make a character, but don't know where to start?  Or maybe  you're looking for some tips?  Or maybe you're just here to judge and criticize?  While I appreciate having you here, I strongly suggest that you go easy on the criticism, please.

  <br/>
  <br/>

Getting a character idea is fun until it comes to actually <i>making</i> the character.  Lucky for you, I have countless characters, most of which are completely different and orginal.  Ahem...Still working on the..."most" part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So allow me to try and assist!
  <br/>
  <br/>
<h2>Making a base</h2>
    <br/>

   Now, before making a character, you should consider starting with the basics.  After all, you're not going to make an amazing character just by doing something, something.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's important to remember that characters have two major components.  Strengths and flaws.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A strength is something that your character is good at.  Something good about them.  It's important to give your character strengths because there can't be a useless character in your story.  What's the point of having a character if they're just there, doing nothing to contribute?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some examples of strengths a character may have are:
    <br/>
    <br/>
  
  <li>Cleverness</li>
  <li>Speed</li>
  <li>Strength</li>
  <li>Organization</li>
  <li>Patience</li>
  <br/>
  And so on
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just as a character cannot be completely starved of strengths, a character cannot be starved of flaws.  Let's be honest, not even Pedro Pascal is completely flawless.  Yeah. I said it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A character's flaws consists of the worse part of their personality.  They're the weak points, the things they're not good at, blah blah blah.  You get it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some examples of flaws a character may have are:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <li>Naivety</li>
  <li>Deceptivity</li>
  <li>Slowness</li>
  <li>Dullness</li>
  <li>Pessimism</li>
  <li>Lazyness</li>
<br/>
  So on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flaws and strengths help to shape the way a character thinks, which affects with the relationship of the character and the plot of your story.  If your character is strong but reckless, they may end up putting themselves or others in danger.  If your character is kind but naive, they may end up getting tricked or taken advantage of.  The personality of a character is very important, so take some time to look through it and discover what may suit the character best.

  <small> Bonus!  If you have trouble organizing your characters, try a character sheet.  It could be any template, as long as it helps you.</small>

  <h2>Powers</h2>

  Ah yes.  The superpowers.  Many iconic characters have them, and yet, they're so hard to come up with!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powers can be very entertaining, but you really don't need them to make an interesting character.  However, if you still want some, here's a few tips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Feel free to take some inspiration from other characters.  It's perfectly fine to take a bit of inspiration!  Do you know how many iconic characters can manipulate plants or shoot ice from their hands?  A lot.  Just don't directly steal the idea and you should be good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you don't wanna take any inspiration from other characters, look around you.  Yes, I mean it literally.  Let me explain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You can find plenty of ideas just from looking at your surroundings.  Every item in your house has a purpose, and some of those items' purposes can actually be turned into a superpower of some kind.  And if you feel insane or stupid  doing it, remember that Stan Lee got the inspiration for Spiderman by looking at a random fly on the wall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h2>Writing the character</h2>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    Now that we've got our Character, let's think about how to write them, for the writers out there, of course.  Now, I quickly realized that writing the character isn't hard at all, at least for me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, if you want to write a character that will stick with your reader till the end, then you have to be attached to that character yourself.  Think like this character, practically <i>be</i> the character.  This will help you picture the characters well in the scenarios you want to put them, and it might help make this character more realistic.  Remember, no one knows this character better than you do.  Not even your other characters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With that being said, don't dump all of the backstory onto your other characters at once.  Take it slow, reveal with time.  This adds a sense of mystery to your story, in my opinion.  A good way to do this is to reveal litte chunks of backstory at a time, and <i>only</i> when it's convinient.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Along with that, your characters don't need to know all of the backstory.  Just the parts that explain things about the character is fine, don't go into too much.  Try imagining that you're telling your friend about the time you went to get ice cream.  You're not going to spend five minutes talking about how you got there only to tell them the point in a second, right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <br/>
  So, about that character.  I'm not very good at explaining, so I hope that you understood what I said.  If you didn't, then I invite you to take a look at some other websites to get your brain juices going.  Remember that all of this is simply what works best for me, so go ahead and explore!  Have fun!
